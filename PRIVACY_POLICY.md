**Privacy Policy for WhatsApp Summarizer Extension**  
Effective Date: [Insert Date]

This Privacy Policy explains how the WhatsApp Summarizer Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, processes, and protects any information that may be generated during its operation. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring full transparency regarding our data practices.

**1. Data Collection**  
- The Extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive data.  
- It reads the text from the currently open WhatsApp Web chat solely for the purpose of summarization.  
- No information is recorded, logged, or retained after processing.

**2. Data Processing**  
- When you invoke the summarization feature, your chat content is processed in real time by the built-in AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash Summarization).  
- Any data used in this process is handled securely and is immediately discarded after a summary is generated.  
- All processing occurs either locally or through secure channels that do not retain user data.

**3. Data Use**  
- The only purpose of processing your chat data is to generate a concise summary for easier consumption of large group conversations.
- Your chat content is never used for any other purpose, nor is it shared with third parties.

**4. User Privacy and Transparency**  
- The Extension is open source; its full codebase is available on GitHub. This transparency ensures that users can verify that no data is being collected or misused.  
- It is strictly prohibited for any derivative or copied version of this Extension to collect, store, or transmit any user data. This measure is in place to protect the privacy of all users.

**5. Data Security**  
- We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect any data processed by the Extension from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.  
- Although we take precautions, no system is completely impenetrable; users should understand that the security of electronic data cannot be 100% guaranteed.

**6. Third-Party Services**  
- The Extension uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash Summarization AI to process chat data. We require that any external service providers involved in this process adhere to strict privacy and security standards.  
- Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of any third-party services that may interact with the Extension.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
- We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be communicated via the Extension or our official website.  
- The effective date will be updated accordingly upon any revision.
